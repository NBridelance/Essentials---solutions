In this course, we will teach you the basics of Cloud Computing using Google Cloud Platform. \n",

    ">Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services‚Äîincluding servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence‚Äîover the Internet (‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what Cloud Computing is, you need to go back to what the world was when it didn't exist. Before, we used to buy actual servers that needed to be setup by your team. Although you had full control of your server, this would come with several drawbacks: \n",
    "\n",
    "* A server was cost expensive especially when you start your business \n",
    "* A server is not scalable (if you have a lot of traffic, you will need to buy more)\n",
    "* Maintenance is hard \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of Cloud Computing started in the early 1990's when companies like [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/eu/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) successfully created their own cloud infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2002, Amazon announced Amazon Web Services which goals was to *enable developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own*. In 2006, they launched their first service which were Amazon Simple Storage Service ([S3](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/s3/)) ü™£ and Elastic Compute Cloud ([EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/ec2/)) üñ•Ô∏è. It really was a first in the history of cloud as small business were now able to create fully virtualized infrastructures. \n",

    "Usually companies store their data within a **Data Lake**. Its purpose is to store [structured as well as unstructured data](https://www.talend.com/fr/resources/structured-vs-unstructured-data/). There are many different types of Data Lakes, among them are: \n",

    "However, you won't analyze it directly from there. You will rather extract the data you need and store it into a **Data Warehouse**. From there your teams will query (usually using SQL) the clean data and analyze it. There are also many different types of Data Warehouse, among them are: \n",

    "Let's build our first Data Lake. To do so, we will be using [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage). \n",
    "\n",

    "First, you will need to log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com). Once you are all good, search for *Cloud Storage* in the search bar: \n",

    "\n",
    "You will need to specify several options for your buckets. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A bucket name** - The name needs to be globally available. It's like a website's domain, if it's already taken, you can't use it. üëå\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A region to store your data** - Your data needs to be stored somewhere in one of Google's Data centers. Depending on your needs, you can choose \n",
    "    * **Multi-Region**: High availability of your data accross the world \n",
    "    * **Dual-Region**: High availability accross two regions of the world\n",

    "    * Of course depending on your choice, price will be different üí∏\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **A type of storage** - Depending on how often you will access your data and its volume, you will need to choose different type of storage: \n",
    "    * **Standard** - Best for short-term storage and frequently accessed data\n",
    "    * **Nearline** - Best for backups and data accessed less than once a month\n",
    "    * **Coldline** - Best for disaster recovery and data accessed less than once a quarter\n",
    "    * **Archive** - Best for long-term digital preservation of data accessed less than once a year\n",
    "    * Again pricing will differ depending on the type of storage \n",

    "4. **Control Access Type** - Whether you want to access your bucket using [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) only or if you want to add ACLs which enable you finer role management. \n",
